# Important Remarks

These wires need to be as short as possible to avoid EMI.<br>
So you shouldn't lengthen them.<br>
The two cables should also be twisted together.

# Cable Welding

Remove the small blue potentiometer.

If you're skilled, you can remove it without dismantling the entire PCB :<br>
Using pliers, gently pull on it to break it and extract it.<br>
Be careful not to pull too hard so as not to break the copper traces !
